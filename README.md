Building up this page from scratch, I learned to use CSS Grid to position elements and sections of the page. I had already learned to use Flexbox and in previous projects I put it into practice, however it is important to have more tools for different situations that I will most likely have to combine these tools with each other, such as flexbox and Grid.
